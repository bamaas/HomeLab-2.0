# 🏠 Homelab

My personal homelab playground, stored as code.

The goal is to seamlessly bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster with all the bells and whistles
— from infrastructure to apps —
in one smooth, reproducible flow.
While keeping things lightweight and simple as possible.

## 🚀 Get up and running

How to deploy the entire cluster from the ground up.

1. **Setup devcontainer.**

    This will [bootstrap](.devcontainer/Dockerfile) all the required tools needed for project development.
    The project uses [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) as a unified manager for tools, environment variables, and scripts.

2. **To provision and configure full cluster simply run:**

    ```bash
    mise run up <env>
    ```

    This command will:

    1. Use Terraform to [provision](./provision/virtual_machines.tf) TalosOS machines on the Proxmox host
    and [initialize](./provision/cluster.tf) the Kubernetes cluster.

    1. [Deploy ArgoCD](.mise/tasks/bootstrap.sh) using the bootstrap configuration to enable GitOps workflows.

    1. Automatically discover and deploy all applications defined in the `apps/` directory through [ArgoCD ApplicationSets](./bootstrap/apps/appset-bootstrap.yaml).

3. **Good to go 🎉**

    The Kubeconfig and Talosconfig files are automaticalled fetched and stored in [.config](.config) directory and your shell is configured [automatically](mise.toml).

    You can now interact with the cluster: `kubectl get pods -A`
  

## 🔥 Foundation stack

This section describes the essential infrastructure components that form the backbone of the homelab environment.

- **Infrastructure**  
  [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve),
  [TalosOS](https://www.talos.dev/) -> [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

- **GitOps**  
  [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/)

- **Networking**  
  [Cilium CNI](https://cilium.io/),
  [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/),
  [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)

- **Storage**  
  [Synology iSCSI & NFS](https://github.com/zebernst/synology-csi-talos)

- **Monitoring**  
  [VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/),
  [Vector](https://vector.dev/),
  [VictoriaMetrics](https://victoriametrics.com/) (Planned)

- **Security**  
  [Cert-Manager](https://cert-manager.io/),
  [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops),
  [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/nl-nl/products/key-vault),
  [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator) (Planned)

- **Authentication**  
  [Dex](https://dexidp.io/) (Planned)

- **Development**  
  [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform),
  [Helm](https://helm.sh/),
  [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/),
  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## ✨ Note worthy features

- **Automatic Application Discovery**  
  No need to manually define ArgoCD application manifests — applications are automatically detected and deployed.

- **Multi-Environment Support**  
  Out-of-the-box support for both `dev` and `prod` environments.

- **Seamless Developer Experience with Mise**  
  All essential commands are encapsulated in Mise scripts.  
  Run `mise tasks` to view the available commands.

- **Pre-Commit Quality Checks**  
  Helm charts are automatically linted and templated before every commit to catch errors early.

- **Reproducible Tooling**  
  Developer environment is reproducible and consistent, with tools managed via [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/).

## 📂 Project structure

This repository follows a GitOps approach using ArgoCD for continuous deployment.
The structure is organized as follows:

* `.lint/`: Contains linting configurations

* `.mise/`: Contains Mise configurations

* `apps/`: Contains all applications deployed to the cluster
  * Organized in `project/namespace/app` structure
  * Each app contains its Helm charts and configurations
  * Namespaces are created automatically during deployment

* `bootstrap/`: Contains initial cluster setup and ArgoCD configuration
  * `argocd/`: ArgoCD core installation and configuration
  * `apps/`: Contains ApplicationSet definitions for automated application discovery and deployment
  * `cluster-resources/`: Essential cluster-wide resources
  * `misc/`: Miscellaneous bootstrap configurations

* `projects/`: Contains ArgoCD project definitions

* `provision/`: Contains Terraform infrastructure provisioning scripts and configurations
