# üè† HomeLab-2.0 üíª

My personal homelab playground, stored as code.

> The goal is to seamlessly bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster with all the bells and whistles  
> ‚Äî from infrastructure to apps ‚Äî  
> in one smooth, reproducible flow.  
> Aiming to keep things as lightweight and simple as possible, while still providing flexibility.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üöÄ One-command cluster provisioning**  
  Provision and configure a full Kubernetes cluster with a single command: `mise run up <env>`  

- **üîç Automatic application discovery**  
  No need to manually define ArgoCD application manifests ‚Äî applications are automatically detected and deployed.

- **üß∞ One entrypoint to rule them all**  
  No more memorizing complex commands. All essential workflows are defined as Mise tasks‚Äîyour single, consistent entrypoint for development.  
  Run `mise tasks` to discover everything you need.

- **‚úÖ Catch issues before they catch you**  
  Every commit runs automatic pre-commit checks that generate and lint your Kubernetes manifests against the API spec.  
  So you catch mistakes early, not in production.

- **üõ†Ô∏è Isolated development setup, zero headaches**  
  Work in an isolated, reproducible environment powered by Mise and Dev Containers  
  so you always have the right tools, versions, and setup from day one.

- **üåç Manage multiple environments effortlessly**  
  Build on a shared base with environment-specific overlays for clear separation and reproducibility.

- **üîê Secret management made easy**  
Secure your secrets with SOPS: encrypted, version-controlled, and stored right alongside your config.  
No external vaults, no guesswork.

## üöÄ Get up and running

How to deploy the entire cluster from the ground up.

1. **Setup devcontainer.**

    This will [setup](.devcontainer/Dockerfile) all the required tools needed for project development.

2. **To provision and configure a full-blown cluster simply run:**

    ```bash
    mise run up <env>
    ```

    This command will:

    1. Use Terraform to [provision](./provision/core/virtual_machines.tf) TalosOS machines on the Proxmox host
    and [initialize](./provision/core/cluster.tf) the Kubernetes cluster.

    1. [Deploy ArgoCD](.mise/tasks/bootstrap.sh) using the bootstrap configuration to enable GitOps workflows.

    1. Automatically discover and deploy all applications defined in the `apps/` directory through [ArgoCD ApplicationSets](./bootstrap/bootstrap.yaml).

3. **Good to go üéâ**

    The Kubeconfig and Talosconfig files are automaticalled fetched and stored in [.config](.config) directory and your shell is configured [automatically](.mise/config.toml).

    You can now interact with the cluster: `kubectl get pods -A`

## üìÇ Project structure

This repository follows a GitOps approach using ArgoCD for continuous deployment.
The structure is organized as follows:

* `.lint/`: Linting configurations

* `.mise/`: Mise configurations
  * `tasks`: Reusable scripts for cluster management, provisioning, and automation.

* `apps/`: Contains all applications deployed to the cluster
  * Organized in `<env>/<project>/<namespace>/<app>` structure
  * Each app contains its kustomization.yaml and configurations
  * Namespaces are created automatically during deployment

* `bootstrap/`: Contains initial cluster setup and ArgoCD configuration
  * `projects/`: Contains ArgoCD project definitions
  * `resources/`: Essential cluster-wide resources
  * `misc/`: Miscellaneous bootstrap configurations

* `provision/`: Contains Terraform infrastructure provisioning scripts and configurations
  * `core/`: Core Terraform modules and scripts for cluster provisioning
  * `<env>/`: Environment-specific Terraform variable files (e.g., `dev/`, `prd/`)
