# Cluster Resources

This directory is designated for cluster-wide resources. All resources that are intended to be shared across multiple services or applications within the cluster should be placed here. This includes configurations, secrets, and any other resources that need to be accessible at the cluster level.

Please ensure that any resources added to this directory are well-documented and follow the naming conventions established for consistency and clarity.
